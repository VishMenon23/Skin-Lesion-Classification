# Skin-Lesion-Classification
Image classification for skin cancer detection
The project aims to :
- Use deep learning techniques to classify lesion samples from a benchmark datasets in an accurate manner.
- Provide strong insight on the statistical comparison of various pre trained neural networks which are used for transfer learning and image processing.
- Perform an in-depth analysis of how each pre trained model performs. The modelsâ€™ performance is evaluated based on evaluation metrics like precision, recall, F1 score etc.
